Place this folder into your Halo 2 Editing Kit "tags" folder.

MAKE SURE TO BACK UP ANY ORIGINAL TAGS THAT WILL BE REPLACED!

Place everything from the dw3 "scenarios" folder into the main H2EK scenarios folder.

Place everything from the dw3 "data" folder into the main H2EK data folder.

Place everything from the dw3 "globals" folder into the main globals tag folder.

Place the multiplayer globals from the dw3 "multiplayer" folder in the main "multiplayer" tags folder.

You'll need to use the "hud_messages" (found in dw3 \ data \ ui \ hud) and the included "h2_fonts" to have the proper pickup messages and icons, respectively. 

Leave everything else here, as the scenarios, tags, etc reference this dw3 folder. It should be plug in and play.

If you have issues, contact me, The Vengeful 'Vadam, on Discord, Twitter, YouTube, or wherever else I might be.
